# Android Device Debugging Guide

## üîç **Current Status Check**

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Project builds successfully
- ‚úÖ Capacitor sync works
- ‚úÖ Android Studio is installed at: `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\bin\studio64.exe`
- ‚úÖ Android project structure is correct

### ‚ùå What Needs Setup:
- ‚ùå ANDROID_HOME environment variable not set
- ‚ùå ADB (Android Debug Bridge) not in PATH
- ‚ùå Device connection not verified

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step-by-Step Debugging**

### **Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables**

#### Option A: Set ANDROID_HOME (Recommended)
1. **Find Android SDK location:**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to **File** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Appearance & Behavior** ‚Üí **System Settings** ‚Üí **Android SDK**
   - Copy the "Android SDK Location" path (usually `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`)

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```powershell
   # Set ANDROID_HOME (replace with your actual path)
   $env:ANDROID_HOME = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
   
   # Add to PATH
   $env:PATH += ";$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools"
   ```

3. **Verify ADB is available:**
   ```powershell
   adb version
   ```

#### Option B: Use Android Studio Directly
If environment setup is complex, we can use Android Studio's built-in tools.

### **Step 2: Device Connection Setup**

#### On Your Android Device:
1. **Enable Developer Options:**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **About Phone**
   - Tap **Build Number** 7 times
   - You'll see "You are now a developer!"

2. **Enable USB Debugging:**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer Options**
   - Enable **USB Debugging**
   - Enable **USB Debugging (Security Settings)** if available

3. **Connect Device:**
   - Connect via USB cable
   - Select **File Transfer** or **MTP** mode
   - Accept the "Allow USB Debugging" prompt on your phone

### **Step 3: Verify Device Connection**

#### Using Android Studio:
1. **Open Android Studio** (should have opened from our command)
2. **Check Device Dropdown:**
   - Look at the top toolbar
   - You should see a dropdown with available devices
   - Your phone should appear in the list

3. **If device doesn't appear:**
   - Click the dropdown
   - Select **"Troubleshoot Device Connections"**
   - Follow the troubleshooting steps

#### Using Command Line (if ADB is set up):
```powershell
adb devices
```
You should see something like:
```
List of devices attached
ABCD1234    device
```

### **Step 4: Build and Deploy**

#### Method 1: Android Studio (Recommended)
1. **In Android Studio:**
   - Click the green **"Run"** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
   - Select your device from the dropdown
   - Click **"OK"**
   - Wait for build and installation

2. **Monitor Build Process:**
   - Watch the bottom "Build" tab for progress
   - Check "Logcat" tab for any errors

#### Method 2: Command Line (if everything is set up)
```powershell
# Build and run
npm run cap:run:android
```

### **Step 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### Issue 1: "No devices found"
**Solutions:**
- Check USB cable connection
- Try different USB ports
- Enable USB debugging on device
- Install device drivers (if needed)

#### Issue 2: "Build failed"
**Solutions:**
```powershell
# Clean and rebuild
npm run cap:build
npm run cap:open:android
```

#### Issue 3: "App crashes on launch"
**Solutions:**
- Check Android Studio Logcat for error details
- Verify all permissions are granted
- Check if Supabase connection works

#### Issue 4: "Gradle sync failed"
**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection (for dependency downloads)
- Verify Android SDK is properly installed
- Try "File" ‚Üí "Invalidate Caches and Restart"
