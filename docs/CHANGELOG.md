- Fixed component prop type mismatches
- Eliminated all TypeScript `any` type usage
- Fixed notification permission handling
- Resolved camera API integration issues
- **Savings Analysis Graphs for Loaded Calculations**: Fixed critical issue where graphs in the savings analysis tab were not displaying for loaded calculations. The problem was that `memoizedTaxData` was not properly updating when tax data was loaded from saved calculations. Added all individual tax data states to the dependency array to ensure proper reactivity.
- **Navigation Flow for Loaded Calculations**: Fixed navigation to start from the "Location & Salary" tab (basics) instead of going directly to the analysis tab when loading a calculation. This provides a better user experience by allowing users to review and modify the loaded data before proceeding.

- **Tax Calculation Tab for Unauthenticated Users**: Fixed issue where tax calculation tab was not showing calculations for unauthenticated users. The problem was that the `hasCalculation` logic using `currentTaxData` instead of `memoizedTaxData`. Updated all references to use the correct reactive tax data source.
- **Tax Data Consistency**: Ensured all functions (`checkExistingCalculation`, `saveCalculationAsNew`, `hasCalculation`) use `memoizedTaxData` for consistency and proper reactivity.
- **Debug Information**: Added development-only debug information to the tax calculation tab to help identify calculation issues.
- **Tax Calculation Values Showing as 0**: Fixed issue where tax brackets and calculated tax values were showing as 0 for unauthenticated users. The problem was that the `setTaxData` function was not properly updating the country-specific tax data states. Added debug logging to track tax calculation flow and ensure proper state updates.

### Changed
- **Tax Calculation Logic**: Updated `hasCalculation` logic to use `memoizedTaxData` instead of `currentTaxData` for better reactivity and consistency across authenticated and unauthenticated users.
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track tax calculation flow and identify issues with state updates.

- ‚è≥ Database migration needs to be applied and tested

### üîß **FinancialDashboard Service Integration - SYSTEMATIC FIX REQUIRED**

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Service Interface Mismatches**: The service interfaces (ExpenseService, BudgetService, AlertService) have different property names and structures than the local interfaces used in FinancialDashboard
- **Property Naming Conflicts**: 
  - Service uses `calculationId` while local uses `calculation_id`
  - Service uses `categoryId` while local uses `category_id`
  - Service uses `userId` while local uses `user_id`
- **Type Safety Issues**: Service responses don't match local interface requirements
- **Missing Properties**: Local interfaces require properties that service interfaces don't provide

#### **Required Systematic Fixes**

**1. Service Interface Alignment**
- Update service interfaces to include all required properties
- Add missing properties like `calculation_id`, `category_id`, `user_id` to service responses
- Ensure service interfaces match local component interfaces

**2. Type Mapping Functions**
- Create proper type mapping functions to convert between service and local interfaces
- Handle nullable fields and optional properties correctly
- Add type guards for data validation

**3. Database Schema Updates**
- Ensure database tables have all required fields
- Add missing columns like `calculation_id` to expenses, budgets, alerts tables
- Update RLS policies to handle new fields

**4. Service Method Updates**
- Update service methods to return data in the expected format
- Add proper error handling for missing fields
- Ensure all CRUD operations work with the local interface structure

**5. Component Interface Updates**
- Update local interfaces to match service capabilities
- Make optional properties truly optional where appropriate
- Add proper default values for missing properties

#### **Files Requiring Updates**
- `src/application/services/ExpenseService.ts` - Add missing properties and update return types
- `src/application/services/BudgetService.ts` - Add missing properties and update return types  
- `src/application/services/AlertService.ts` - Add missing properties and update return types
- `src/components/dashboard/FinancialDashboard.tsx` - Update to use correct service methods
- Database migrations - Add missing columns and update RLS policies

#### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Phase 1**: Update database schema to include all required fields ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2**: Update service interfaces to match local component needs üîÑ
3. **Phase 3**: Update FinancialDashboard to use correct service methods ‚è≥
4. **Phase 4**: Add proper type mapping and error handling ‚è≥
5. **Phase 5**: Test all CRUD operations end-to-end ‚è≥

### üîß FinancialDashboard Service Integration Issues - NEEDS FIXING
- **Identified missing service methods** in FinancialDashboard.tsx:
  - `UserDataService.getExpenseCategories()` ‚Üí Should use `BudgetService.getExpenseCategories()`
  - `UserDataService.getCalculationExpenses()` ‚Üí Should use `ExpenseService.getExpensesByUserId()`
  - `UserDataService.getCalculationBudgets()` ‚Üí Should use `BudgetService.getUserBudgets()`
  - `UserDataService.getCalculationAlerts()` ‚Üí Should use `AlertService.getUserAlerts()`
  - `UserDataService.addExpense()` ‚Üí Should use `ExpenseService.createExpense()`
