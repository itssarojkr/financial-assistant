- Eliminated all TypeScript `any` type usage
- Fixed notification permission handling
- Resolved camera API integration issues
- **Savings Analysis Graphs for Loaded Calculations**: Fixed critical issue where graphs in the savings analysis tab were not displaying for loaded calculations. The problem was that `memoizedTaxData` was not properly updating when tax data was loaded from saved calculations. Added all individual tax data states to the dependency array to ensure proper reactivity.

- **Tax Calculation Tab for Unauthenticated Users**: Fixed issue where tax calculation tab was not showing calculations for unauthenticated users. The problem was caused by the `hasCalculation` logic using `currentTaxData` instead of `memoizedTaxData`. Updated all references to use the correct reactive tax data source.
- **Tax Data Consistency**: Ensured all functions (`checkExistingCalculation`, `saveCalculationAsNew`, `hasCalculation`) use `memoizedTaxData` for consistency and proper reactivity.
- **Debug Information**: Added development-only debug information to the tax calculation tab to help identify calculation issues.
- **Tax Calculation Values Showing as 0**: Fixed issue where tax brackets and calculated tax values were showing as 0 for unauthenticated users. The problem was that the `setTaxData` function was not properly updating the country-specific tax data states. Added debug logging to track tax calculation flow and ensure proper state updates.

### Changed
- **Tax Calculation Logic**: Updated `hasCalculation` logic to use `memoizedTaxData` instead of `currentTaxData` for better reactivity and consistency across authenticated and unauthenticated users.
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track tax calculation flow and identify issues with state updates.
- **State Management**: Replaced mutable `setTaxData` reassignment with a proper `useCallback` implementation that correctly handles country-specific tax data updates.

## [Previous Versions]

### [1.0.0] - 2024-12-18
- Initial release with basic tax calculation functionality
- Web app with core features
- Basic mobile detection and routing 

### Fixed
- **Country Selection Bug**: Fixed critical issue where selecting a country in the CountrySelector component was not properly updating `salaryData.country`. The `onValueChange` handler was only updating `selectedCountryId` but not calling the `handleCountryChange` function that actually updates the salary data. This caused the debug console to show empty `salaryDataCountry` values even after country selection.
- **State and City Selection**: Fixed similar issues with state and city selection handlers to ensure proper data flow and validation.
- **Tax Calculator Button Visibility**: Fixed issue where unauthenticated users couldn't see the "Next" button to proceed with calculations even after entering all required values. The button now properly validates that tax calculations have been completed before enabling navigation to the analysis tab.
- **Savings Analysis Graphs for Loaded Calculations**: Fixed critical issue where graphs in the savings analysis tab were not displaying for loaded calculations. The problem was that `memoizedTaxData` was not properly updating when tax data was loaded from saved calculations. Added all individual tax data states to the dependency array to ensure proper reactivity.
- **Navigation Flow for Loaded Calculations**: Fixed navigation to start from the "Location & Salary" tab (basics) instead of going directly to the analysis tab when loading a calculation. This provides a better user experience by allowing users to review and modify the loaded data before proceeding.
- **Tax Data Reactivity**: Enhanced the `memoizedTaxData` calculation to directly compute the current tax data based on country instead of relying on mutable variables, ensuring proper reactivity when tax data is loaded from saved calculations.

### Added
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved button state management with visual feedback (disabled state with gray styling) when calculations are incomplete.
- **Validation Logic**: Added comprehensive validation to ensure tax calculations are complete before allowing progression to the next step.
- **Proper Event Handling**: Updated all location selection handlers to use the correct functions that update both the UI state and the underlying salary data.
- **Unified Card Layout**: Redesigned the Location & Salary section to use a single card with a vertical divider separating location and salary information, providing a cleaner and more cohesive user interface.

### Technical Improvements
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type safety in tax calculation components with proper prop validation.
- **Component Props**: Updated component interfaces to match expected prop types for better type safety.
- **Data Flow**: Fixed data flow issues in CountrySelector component to ensure proper state synchronization between UI components and salary data.
- **UI Layout**: Improved the layout structure with better visual hierarchy, responsive design, and cleaner button placement outside the divided content area.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized the 2-column layout to be visible on screens with a minimum width of 768px (md breakpoint), providing better usability on medium-sized screens and tablets.
- **Vertical Divider Positioning**: Fixed the vertical divider positioning by using absolute positioning with proper centering (`left-1/2` and `transform -translate-x-1/2`) to ensure it appears correctly between the two columns on medium screens and above. 

### Fixed
- **UserDashboard Null Reference Error**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')" error in the UserDashboard component. Added null checks for `effectiveTaxRate` and other data fields to prevent crashes when saved calculation data contains null values.
- **Financial Dashboard Button Navigation**: Fixed issue where the "Financial Dashboard" button in the navigation bar was redirecting to the homepage instead of the dashboard. Changed the navigation path from `/` to `/dashboard` in both the main navigation and dropdown menu.
- **Dynamic Import Error**: Fixed "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" error that was preventing the application from loading. The issue was caused by trying to reassign a `const` variable (`setTaxData`) in useEffect blocks. Replaced the reassignment logic with a proper `useCallback` implementation that handles country-specific tax data updates correctly.
- **Tax Calculation Values Showing as 0**: Fixed issue where tax brackets and calculated tax values were showing as 0 for unauthenticated users. The problem was that the `setTaxData` function was not properly updating the country-specific tax data states. Added debug logging to track tax calculation flow and ensure proper state updates.
- **Tax Calculation Tab for Unauthenticated Users**: Fixed issue where tax calculation tab was not showing calculations for unauthenticated users. The problem was caused by the `hasCalculation` logic using `currentTaxData` instead of `memoizedTaxData`. Updated all references to use the correct reactive tax data source.
- **Tax Data Consistency**: Ensured all functions (`checkExistingCalculation`, `saveCalculationAsNew`, `hasCalculation`) use `memoizedTaxData` for consistency and proper reactivity.
- **Debug Information**: Added development-only debug information to the tax calculation tab to help identify calculation issues. 

### Changed
- **Financial Dashboard Page Consistency**: Updated the Financial Dashboard page to have the same structure and styling as the tax calculator page for better consistency across the application. This includes using the same background gradient, header component, and container structure. 
- **Clickable Financial Assistant Logo**: Made the Financial Assistant logo in the header clickable to navigate to the home page. Added hover effects and proper styling for better user experience.

### Added
- **Save Calculation Validation**: Added comprehensive validation to prevent users from saving calculations unless they have entered complete details. Required fields include country, state/province, valid salary amount, and currency. City and locality remain optional. Tax calculation must also be complete before saving is allowed. 

### Fixed
- **Alert Overview Cards**: Fixed alert overview cards in Financial Dashboard to show proper calculated values instead of hardcoded data
