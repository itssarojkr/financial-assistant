- **Debug Information**: Added development-only debug information to the tax calculation tab to help identify calculation issues.
- **Tax Calculation Values Showing as 0**: Fixed issue where tax brackets and calculated tax values were showing as 0 for unauthenticated users. The problem was that the `setTaxData` function was not properly updating the country-specific tax data states. Added debug logging to track tax calculation flow and ensure proper state updates.

### Changed
- **Tax Calculation Logic**: Updated `hasCalculation` logic to use `memoizedTaxData` instead of `currentTaxData` for better reactivity and consistency across authenticated and unauthenticated users.
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track tax calculation flow and identify issues with state updates.

  - Service uses `categoryId` while local uses `category_id`
  - Service uses `userId` while local uses `user_id`
- **Type Safety Issues**: Service responses don't match local interface requirements
- **Missing Properties**: Local interfaces require properties that service interfaces don't provide

#### **Required Systematic Fixes**

**1. Service Interface Alignment**
- Update service interfaces to include all required properties
- Add missing properties like `calculation_id`, `category_id`, `user_id` to service responses
- Ensure service interfaces match local component interfaces

**2. Type Mapping Functions**
- Create proper type mapping functions to convert between service and local interfaces
- Handle nullable fields and optional properties correctly
- Add type guards for data validation

- Update RLS policies to handle new fields

**4. Service Method Updates**
- Update service methods to return data in the expected format
- Add proper error handling for missing fields
- Ensure all CRUD operations work with the local interface structure

**5. Component Interface Updates**
- Update local interfaces to match service capabilities
- Make optional properties truly optional where appropriate
- Add proper default values for missing properties

#### **Files Requiring Updates**
- `src/application/services/ExpenseService.ts` - Add missing properties and update return types
- `src/application/services/BudgetService.ts` - Add missing properties and update return types  
- `src/application/services/AlertService.ts` - Add missing properties and update return types

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Refactored FinancialDashboard to use unified ExpenseService, BudgetService, and AlertService for all CRUD operations (add, edit, delete) for expenses, budgets, and alerts.
- Updated all mapping and type conversions for compatibility between UI and domain/service types (e.g., categoryId string/number conversion).
- Removed all outdated usages of UserDataService for expenses, budgets, and alerts.
- Ensured all saved calculation and modal flows use the correct types and service interfaces.
- Added detailed logging and error handling to FinancialDashboard to identify why existing calculations are not loading for authenticated users.
- Added test calculation fallback for debugging when no saved calculations are found.
- Improved UserDataService error reporting and response handling in dashboard data loading.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing transformSavedCalculation function that was causing calculations not to load in FinancialDashboard.
- Fixed UserDataService integration in FinancialDashboard to properly handle saved tax calculations.
- Fixed type mapping between UserData and ExtendedSavedCalculation formats.
- Fixed React hooks error in FinancialDashboard by moving debug useEffect to proper location with other hooks to resolve "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error. 

### Added
- Enhanced debugging capabilities in FinancialDashboard with comprehensive console logging.
- Added fallback test calculation for development and debugging purposes.
- Enhanced logging in location data population script with detailed progress tracking, showing which country/state/city names are being inserted, error handling, and timing information.
- Enhanced logging in localities population script with detailed API call tracking, cache usage, locality processing, database operations, and overall progress statistics. 

### Verified
- **Location Data Population Script**: Verified city insertion code and data parsing
  - ‚úÖ **Data parsing is correct**: Column mapping for cities data is accurate (name, country_code, state_code, population, latitude, longitude, timezone)
  - ‚úÖ **Country filtering works**: Script correctly filters cities by country code parameter
  - ‚úÖ **State mapping logic fixed**: Improved buildIdMaps() function with proper reverse lookup and debugging
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data inconsistency issue identified**: Cities data contains mixed state codes from multiple countries
    - India (IN): Uses numeric state codes (01, 02, 03, etc.)
    - Indiana, USA (US): Uses "IN" as state code
    - Guam (GU): Uses "IN" as state code
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **State code mismatch**: Cities data state codes don't always match admin1CodesASCII.txt
  - üìä **Current status**: Script processes 1 country, 36 states, but 5664 cities are skipped due to missing state mappings
  - üí° **Recommendation**: Consider using a more comprehensive state/province mapping or alternative data source

### Fixed
- **Location Data Population Script**: Fixed populate.mjs to accept country code parameters and filter data accordingly
  - Added command line argument processing for country codes
  - Implemented filtering for countries, states, and cities by specified country codes
  - Added validation to show which countries were found vs not found
  - Added detailed logging and progress tracking
  - Usage: `node populate.mjs IN US CA UK` to populate data for specific countries only
  - Previously the script processed ALL countries regardless of parameters
