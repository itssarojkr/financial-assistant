## Change Log

_This section must be updated with every change, deletion, or rename in the codebase._

- **2024-12-19**: Comprehensive feature analysis completed. Updated knowledge base with current implementation status for all major features. Identified completed features (95%+), features needing minor enhancements (85-95%), and remaining tasks for independent implementation. (AI)
- **2024-07-07**: Added calculation_id columns and RLS policies for expenses, budgets, and alerts. Updated domain entities and UserDataService for calculation linkage. Refactored FinancialDashboard for per-calculation data. (AI)
- **2024-07-07**: Fixed migration errors by removing duplicate RLS policy creation for profiles. (AI)
- **2024-07-07**: Created this knowledge base and file/folder descriptions. (AI)

## Architectural & Security Decisions

- RLS (Row Level Security) policies for the `profiles` table are created in 001_initial_schema.sql and optimized in 002_security_optimization.sql. The optimized version uses ((SELECT auth.uid()) = id) for performance. Do not recreate this policy in future migrations unless updating or dropping it first.
- All calculation-linked data (expenses, budgets, alerts) must use the calculation_id field for proper multi-calculation support.
- All migrations must be idempotent: use DROP POLICY IF EXISTS before CREATE POLICY, and avoid duplicating policy creation across migrations.
- Supabase client credentials are managed via environment variables and the Supabase CLI, not hardcoded in the codebase.
